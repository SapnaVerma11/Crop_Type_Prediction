# Crop_Type_Prediction

## Context
Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Here, is the dataset which would allow the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

## Context
This comes under a classification problem.I have applied KNN algorithm to solve this problem

## Data fields
N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil ,
P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil ,
K - ratio of Potassium content in soil ,
temperature - temperature in degree Celsius ,
humidity - relative humidity in % ,
ph - ph value of the soil ,
rainfall - rainfall in mm ,
